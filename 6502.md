> as for the clock schematic, I feel the following should be changed:
> - in 2020, when driving logic ICs (especially edge-sensitive logic), a CMOS 555 timer should be used instead of Bipolar 555 timer. A bipolar 555 should be used if you want to drive a big load, or not driving clock inputs of logic ICs, or trying to make something as cheap as possible.
> - Film capacitors should be used in the RC circuit, such as 1uF C6 and 100nF C3. Film caps aren't crazy expensive, thus no excuse to not use them, especially if you buy them from Tayda. As for the 1uF C6, even a 10% tantalum capacitor is a better choice than a 20% electrolytic capacitor in an RC timing circuit. As for the 100nF C3, most dirt cheap ceramic disc capacitors have a bad 20% tolerance, for a little more cost 10% types can be found, though it should be noted that very low capacitance (under 1000pF) ceramic discs might be C0G/NP0 which are great but at higher capacitances it is very unlikely they are C0G/NP0.
> - if bipolar timer is being used, put both a 100nF and 47uF capacitor across its VCC and GND pins. Using bipolar 555 timers without adequate decoupling is asking for trouble! https://sound-au.com/articles/555-timer.htm
