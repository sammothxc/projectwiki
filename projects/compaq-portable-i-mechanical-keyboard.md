# Compaq Portable Plus Mechanical Keyboard

The Compaq Portable uses a proprietary connector that seems to just be a fancy 2x3 right angle pin header.
```
Female connector that plugs into the keyboard, fat side up:

 [123]
 |456|

 1: GND
 2: VCC (+12V)
 3: GND
 4: RST?
 5: DATA
 6: CLK
 ```
 THe pinout also uses +12V for VCC, which is then dropped down by a voltage regulator on the keyboard.
 
 Pinout of standard XT keyboard connector:
